# CMS UPC J/ψ Photoproduction Analysis

Welcome! This page documents a full MC simulation and analysis workflow for coherent J/ψ production in ultra-peripheral O–O collisions at the LHC.

---

## 💡 Overview

- 💥 Event generation with [STARlight](https://starlight.hepforge.org/)
- 🧮 Full CMS simulation: GENSIM → DIGIRAW → RECO
- 🌟 Production of flat ntuple (diMuTree) for physics analysis
- 📈 Mass fitting and yield extraction using RooFit
- ✅ Written and validated by Albert Xu (Rice University)
