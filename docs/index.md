# CMS UPC J/ψ Photoproduction Analysis

Welcome! This page documents a full MC simulation and analysis workflow for coherent J/ψ production in ultra-peripheral O–O collisions at the LHC.

---

## Overview

- Event generation with [STARlight](https://starlight.hepforge.org/)
- Full CMS simulation: GENSIM → DIGIRAW → RECO
- Production of flat ntuple (diMuTree) for physics analysis
- Mass fitting and yield extraction using RooFit
