# STARlight Configuration and Scripts

This folder contains my custom STARlight input files, run scripts, and sample output used in simulating coherent $J/\psi$ production in ultra-peripheral Oâ€“O collisions at the LHC.

Files will include:
- `config.in`: STARlight input configuration
- `run_starlight.sh`: Shell script to compile and run STARlight
- `output_sample.lhe`: Generated LHE file (optional)

See [https://starlight.hepforge.org](https://starlight.hepforge.org) for original source.
