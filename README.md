# CMS-UPC-OO-Run-Codes

This repository contains the simulation and analysis workflow for coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction in ultra-peripheral O–O collisions at the LHC, using STARlight and the CMS full simulation chain.

## Structure
- `starlight/`: STARlight configuration and event generation scripts
- `cmssw/`: Configuration files for CMS simulation (GENSIM → DIGIRAW → RECO)
- `analysis/`: ROOT/RooFit scripts for mass fitting and rapidity yield extraction
- `notes/`: Personal notes on the simulation procedure and analysis logic

## Goals
- Simulate $J/\psi$ production in ultra-peripheral O–O collisions
- Process LHE output through full CMS simulation
- Perform mass fitting and extract yields across rapidity bins
- Provide clean, reproducible documentation of the full workflow

## Tools
- STARlight
- CMSSW (GENSIM, DIGIRAW, RECO)
- ROOT / RooFit
- Python, Bash, C++
