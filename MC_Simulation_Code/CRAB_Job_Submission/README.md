# Crab Submission Process

## To submit the process, we need to split the output file from STARlight to many (Usually thousands) of output files

cd /Users/albertxu/Desktop/STARlight_Folder/starlightLHE-master/generateLHE/splitSTARlight.sh (# The folder that contains the code to split the .out files)

## Make sure you look into the code split_STARlight.sh, there is a copy in the folder
